Assignment 1
You are given an array of integers, and you are required to sort this array using one of the following sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, or Insertion Sort. Your task is to implement the chosen sorting algorithm and analyze its time complexity.
Implement one of the sorting algorithms mentioned above (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, or Insertion Sort) in Python.
Apply your sorting algorithm to the given array of integers.
Provide the sorted array as the output.
Analyze the time complexity of the sorting algorithm you implemented. Explain whether it is a stable sort and how it performs on different types of input data (e.g., already sorted, reverse sorted, random data).
Compare the time complexity of your chosen sorting algorithm with at least one other sorting algorithm (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, or Python's built-in 
sorted function). Explain the differences and scenarios where one algorithm might be preferred over the other.

Input:
An unsorted list of integers (e.g., [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]).

Assignment 3
You are tasked with solving the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm. The N-Queens problem is to place N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Your goal is to implement the algorithm, find all possible solutions for a given N, and analyze its time complexity.
⦁	Implement a backtracking algorithm in Python to solve the N-Queens problem.
⦁	Apply your algorithm to find all possible solutions for a given N (e.g., N = 4 or N = 8). Ensure that you generate all unique solutions.
⦁	Present the solutions as chessboard representations, indicating the placement of queens (e.g., using 'Q' for queens and '.' for empty squares).
⦁	Explain the backtracking approach, including how you generate and validate solutions and how you handle conflicts between queens.
⦁	Analyze the time complexity of your algorithm and discuss its efficiency for larger values of N.

Input:
⦁	An integer N (N ≥ 4) representing the size of the N×N chessboard and the number of queens to place.

Output:
⦁	All possible solutions to the N-Queens problem for the given N, presented as chessboard representations.

Instructions:
⦁	Implement a backtracking algorithm to solve the N-Queens problem in Python.
⦁	Apply your algorithm to find all possible solutions for the provided value of N (e.g., N = 4 or N = 8).
