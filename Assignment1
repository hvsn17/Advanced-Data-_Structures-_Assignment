Time Complexity Analysis:
Bubble Sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) where 'n' is the number of elements in the array.
It has an average-case time complexity of O(n^2).
Best-case time complexity is O(n) when the array is already sorted (with the optimized flag).

Stability:
Bubble Sort is stable, which means it maintains the relative order of equal elements in the sorted array.

Comparison with Quick Sort:
Quick Sort is generally more efficient than Bubble Sort.
Quick Sort has an average-case time complexity of O(n log n), which is significantly faster than Bubble Sort's average-case O(n^2).
Quick Sort is a better choice for large datasets and is widely used in practice.
