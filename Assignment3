Explanation of Backtracking Approach:
The is_safe function checks if a queen can be safely placed in a given cell by examining the row, column, and diagonals.
The backtrack function recursively explores all possible queen placements row by row, and it backtracks if a safe placement is not possible.
We maintain a solutions list to store all valid solutions.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is exponential, O(N!).
In the worst case, we need to consider all possible permutations of queen placements.

Perfomance for Larger N:
The algorithm's time complexity grows rapidly with N.
It is efficient for small to moderate values of N (e.g., N â‰¤ 12), but it becomes impractical for larger N values.
For larger N values, more advanced algorithms or heuristics may be needed to find solutions efficiently.
